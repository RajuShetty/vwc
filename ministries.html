              <span>The Bible says in Psalm 127:4 that children are like arrows in a warrior’s hands. How true! At Vineyard Worker of Christ Church, the children are trained from their early age itself about the One True Living God – Jesus.</span>
                     <span> Every Sunday morning, more than 1000 kids attend the Children’s church where they are taught the bible and the great Love of Jesus for us. According to their ages, the kids are categorized in groups namely Moses group, Daniel group, Benjamin group and Samuel group. We believe that as these kids grow up, they may one day stand as strong warriors for God’s Kingdom.</span>
