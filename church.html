The tears flowing down the sweet faces of these people is the greatest testimony of HIS Love. Lives are changed radically and people see the Light of Jesus lighting their paths.</p>

Pastor Peter is supported by his dear and equally dynamic wife, Pastor Jayshree Silway who is gifted in Marathi translation and has touched thousands of lives with the gift of an anointed voice. Carrying the Mandate from God to preach the Good News to the state of Maharashtra, together they have made a great impact on the state. </p>
			<p> Services are conducted also every Sunday, Monday and Thursday where members and disciples feed on the Word.  Leaders are raised for leading the Gospel outreach all over the state. Children are brought up soaked in the Word of God under the Children’s Church every Sunday morning.</p>
