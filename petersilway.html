          <p>The day was 23rd September, 1989. The Lord in His Mercy showed <strong> Pastor Peter Silway </strong> a divine vision which was to be his mission for the rest of his life. In the vision he saw a huge stretch of land where thousands of people had gathered together. People from different background and all flocked together in one place. This was soon going to be what today stands as “Vineyard Workers of Christ Church”.</p> 

          <div class="highlight">
            <p>“The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised”</p>
            <span class="little-text light-text"> Luke 4:18 <em> Bible</em></span>
          </div>

          <p><strong> Pastor Peter Silway</strong> was given this Divine Mandate from God Himself that was etched upon his heart that very day. Obedience followed this Divine Mandate! The seed was sown and the work of His Kingdom had begun. From very humble beginnings, <strong> Pastor Peter </strong> started following God’s voice to preach the Good News to the land of Maharashtra. Obstacles came his way but the “One who calls is faithful and HE will do it”. The Lord sailed the ship to bring this vision to a reality. </p>
